Atoms
=====

Atoms, like in real life, make up a lot of your code. You might not directly interact with an atom, but underneath the covers a lot of dragon is about atoms. Atoms are specified as starting with and containing any characters other than whitespace characters. Here are some examples:

``` coffee
# An atom
a

# A really long atom
mary_had_a_little_lamb_fleece_as_white_as_snow

# These are also atoms
9s
true
+d_s{}f-f/()xz@
10
```

By simply typing the atom you either reference an already defined atom or define a new atom. On their own atoms don't do anything special, but are often used as keys in Dictionaries.
